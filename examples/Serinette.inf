! Serinette - Basic example of playing music and sound effects.

! The serinette (a type of music box) plays music when it opens and a sound effect when it's wound. We'll also show its picture when it's examined.
! The example media files can be downloaded from http://vorple-if.com/doc/inform7/examples .

! You should have one folder for the audio and one folder for the images, and change the "vorple.options.resource_paths" in play.html to point to the right folders.
